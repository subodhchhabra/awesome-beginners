# Awesome-Beginners
An `awesome` type curated list of resources for complete beginners to programming, or
people that are completely unaware of the world of programming.

Think of it this way. If you had a little kid, or a wife (or a husband, or family, etc.) you wanted to teach how
to program, a few unexpected questions come up:

* Where do you start as a mentor?
* What's the first programming language they should learn that would not scare them off?
* How should they interface with the language? a visual editor? IDE?
* Should they even start with a programming language?
* How to keep everything fun?


Pull requests happily accepted.


### Languages
*Programming languages that embrace people with little or no programming experience*

* [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) - Ruby is a soft, happy language to start with.
* [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) - Javascript is everywhere, which is why it might make sense to learn and then jump into the browser for interactions.
* [Python (Turtle)](https://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html) - Turtle for Python. Thanks @rantav


### Environments
*Programming experience environments that are easy to start with*

* [Processing](https://processing.org/) [processing.js](http://processingjs.org/)- THE non-programming programming environment.
* [KidsRuby](http://kidsruby.com/) - Ruby based, an IDE and various components such as Robotics etc. for full immersion.
* [Bocko](https://github.com/mfikes/bocko) - Simple Clojure imperative graphics
* [Robots](https://github.com/npryce/robots) - A simple game to teach the basics of programming
* [Code Combat](http://codecombat.com/) - An almost real quest (game) driven by the player learning to code
* [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) - A visual programming environment for kids by MIT
* [ScratchJR](http://www.scratchjr.org/) - Tablet application version of Scratch for little children (ages 5-7). No reading or writing skills are required.
* [Hopscotch](http://www.gethopscotch.com/) - Another visual programming environment with an app and more
* [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) - Phaser is a fun, free and fast 2D game framework for making HTML5 games for desktop and mobile web browsers, supporting Canvas and WebGL rendering
* [CodeMonkey](https://www.playcodemonkey.com/) - Learning CoffeeScript for kids through a nice interactive game
* [Turtle Academy](https://www.turtleacademy.com/) - Learn Programming using the Logo language. Site is multilingual, and the actual logo commands are also translated to the local languages, making it ideal for kids who knows only their mother tongue




### Training
*Beginner or medium level training programs*

* [code.org](https://code.org/) - an initiative that's packed with material for all ages
